Navigation Examples
==============

`legacy/` are old examples that are no longer updated.  

`MenuDemo` (java) is examples are menus, pop-up menus, action buttons, sub menus, and extra menus in fragments.

`MenuDemo_kt` (kotlin) is examples are menus, pop-up menus, action buttons, sub menus, and extra menus in fragments.

`NavDrawer` (java) was Google's drawer example show content in the main area, it's been heavily updated and corrected.  Also a search bar entry.

`NavDrawer_kt` (kotlin) was Google's drawer example show content in the main area, converted to kotlin.  Also a search bar entry.

`NavDrawerDemo` (java) This shows how a layout drawer is used and setup.  It's very simple, with just a textview in the "main content".  This uses the actionbar, while the ToolbarnavDrawerDemo uses a toolbar. 

`NavDrawerDemo_kt` (kotlin) This shows how a layout drawer is used and setup.  It's very simple, with just a textview in the "main content".  This uses the actionbar, while the ToolbarnavDrawerDemo uses a toolbar. 

`NavDrawerFragDemo` (java) is listview example using the listviewFragmentDemo from the listview directory. 

`NavDrawerFragDemo_kt` (kotlin) is listview example using the listviewFragmentDemo from the listview directory.   

`NavDrawerFragViewModelDemo` (java) is NavDrawerFragDemo reworked to use a viewmodel, instead of all the callbacks.  The code is greatly simplified without callbacks/listeners.

`NavDrawerFragViewModelDemo_kt` (kotlin) is NavDrawerFragDemo reworked to use a viewmodel, instead of all the callbacks.  The code is greatly simplified without callbacks/listeners.

`NavigationRailDemo` (java) shows how to use the NavigationRailView (which is very similiar to a bottomNavigationView.

`NavigationRailDemo_kt` (kotlin) shows how to use the NavigationRailView (which is very similiar to a bottomNavigationView.

`toolbarnavDrawerDemo`  (java) uses a toolbar, instead of a actionbar.  The rest of the code is the same as the NavDrawerDemo. 

`toolbarnavDrawerDemo_kt` (kotlin) uses a toolbar, instead of a actionbar.  The rest of the code is the same as the NavDrawerDemo.

`ToolbarDemo` use a toolbar and not a actionbar.  The style is DayNight.NoActionBar. So the toolbar is added in the layout, see the app_bar.xml and activity_mail.xml, plus main_activity.java for the bulk of the code.  Again device-4.4.png and device-5.0.png shows the design.  Otherwise the example really doesn't do anything.  Since there is no real code, I'm not going to make a "kotlin" version.
